# Zip Craker

An ecnrypted ZIP file password cracker using dictionary attacks. To run this `python` script, simply open your terminal and run it like this: `python app.py zipfilepath dictionaryfile`.

For instance:

```bash
┌──(dave㉿kali)-[~/Documents/ZIP]
└─$ python app.py secret.zip rockyou.txt
```

**[^] Disclaimer**: I tried my hands on this project for practice purpose with the only aim of improving my python scripting skills. Only use this on zip files you own or ones you're authorized to use it on.
